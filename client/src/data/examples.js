        title: 'Japanese Modern',
        prompt: `A Japanese Edo-period Ukiyo-e woodblock print. The overall feeling is a surreal collaboration between masters like Hokusai and Hiroshige, reimagining modern technology through an ancient lens. The scene: a busy Shibuya scramble crossing. Edo transformation logic: Characters wear Edo-era kimono but perform modern actions. All technology is transformed into surreal Edo equivalents: Smartphones are glowing, illustrated paper scrolls being read intently. Metro stations and trains are giant articulated wooden centipede carriages shuffling through crowds. Skyscrapers are reimagined as endless, towering wooden pagodas reaching into dramatic clouds. Robots and mecha appear as giant, armored woodblock golems. The composition uses a flattened perspective with large, bold, hand-carved ink outlines. The background features heavily stylized Ukiyo-e wave patterns and dramatic, swirling clouds, with a distant Mt. Fuji visible on the horizon. The image must look like a physical print, not a digital painting. Texture: strong visible wood grain texture and rough paper fibers throughout the piece. Printing imperfections: pigment bleeding is evident. Simulate hand-pressed plates with slight color misalignment for authenticity. Color palette: strictly limited to traditional mineral pigments, with dominant use of Prussian blue, vermilion red, and muted yellow ochre. Lighting: soft, flat, shadow-free lighting with no digital gradients. Aspect ratio is 3:4 vertical poster. Include vertical Japanese calligraphy describing the scene and a traditional red artist seal stamp in a corner.`

        title: 'Profile Avatar',
        prompt: `A confident man standing against a deep red studio background, wearing a fitted black turtleneck and red-tinted rectangular sunglasses. He faces slightly to the side with a calm, composed expression. Minimalist fashion aesthetic, sharp jawline, clean haircut, modern tech-founder vibe. Soft but directional studio lighting creating gentle shadows on the face and body. High contrast between the black outfit and red backdrop. Cinematic, editorial portrait style. Ultra-realistic, shallow depth of field, crisp focus, premium fashion photography look.`

        title: 'Scribble Art',
        prompt: `Convert the uploaded face photo into a very abstract and chaotic scribble art with very loose, scattered and extremely random black ink lines, creating an image of the person in the photo standing in a good pose, wearing a proper shirt and pants. The lines should barely make out the face, emphasizing chaos and abstraction rather than clear definition. Maintain the original expression and proportions as a general underlying composition.`

        prompt: `A vintage patent document for INVENTION, styled after late 1800s United States Patent Office filings. The page features precise technical drawings with numbered callouts (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) showing front, side, and exploded views. Handwritten annotations in fountain-pen ink describe mechanisms. The paper is aged ivory with foxing stains and soft fold creases. An official embossed seal and red wax stamp appear in the corner. A hand-signed inventor's name and date appear at the bottom. The entire image feels like a recovered archival document—authoritative, historic, and slightly mysterious.`
